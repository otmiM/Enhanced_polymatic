This improved Version of Polymatic with new functioanlities added to streamline constructing the polymerization for complex systems. 

The Original Polymatic codes are developed by Dr. Lauren Abott and Dr. Coray Colina. The Original code can be found [here](https://nanohub.org/resources/17278) and the original Polymatic Paper can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00214-013-1334-z).

This new version is compatible with High-Performance Computing environment and does not require any editing to update directories or import new libraries.
It also offers a way to generate types.txt file from a lammps datafile if these types are available, or writing it from scatch. 

It only requires Editing the forcefield setting in the scripts folder. It is recommended that you read the Polymatic Manual.  

Enhanced_Polymatic also allows for high throughput implementation of Polymatic to create the initial structures for different polymer systems.
